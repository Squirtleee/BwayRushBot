# BwayRushBot

The Reddit bot, BwayRushBot, detects posts and comments in the Broadway subreddit for various keyword combinations to record which shows have recently been offering discounted tickets, and it automatically writes the collected data into a text file. The bot was built with Python and the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW).
